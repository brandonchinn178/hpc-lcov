# minimal-example

This directory contains a trivial Haskell project with a deliberately designed
test suite to cover a few common coverage situations.

`lcov.info` contains the LCOV file generated by `hpc-lcov` after running the
`minimal-example` test suite with coverage enabled. This file is checked in CI
to always be up to date.

## Usage

```bash
stack build hpc-lcov
HPC_LCOV=$(stack exec which hpc-lcov)

cp stack.yaml "minimal-example/"
cd "minimal-example/"
stack test --coverage
"${HPC_LCOV}"
```
